# Module 3 — Academic

Status: Complete (migration → repository → service → API → UI, two
slices: `classes` then `timetable_periods` + `faculty_allocation`).

## Tables
- `classes` — class/section identity, `tutor_user_id` → `users(id)`
  (never `staff(id)`, per BusinessRules' "Resolved (Module 2 kickoff)"
  entry), `timetable_data` JSONB (opaque CSV-derived grid — matches
  the real TutorClass.jsx/TutorClassMonitor.jsx rendering, not
  normalized), `timetable_status` (`No Tutor`/`Pending HOD`/`Pending
  Principal`/`Approved`/`Rejected` — no CHECK, service-enforced).
  `Approved` is the literal gate value CLAUDE.md rule 7 references for
  unlocking Attendance.
- `timetable_periods` — shared bell schedule, one row per
  (college_id, day_of_week, hour_index). Added later, triggered by
  Module 4's second slice needing a real link to verify "the staff
  member scheduled for a period" (see attendanceService.js, `82f8479`).
- `faculty_allocation` — who teaches what, when; the structured link
  `classes.timetable_data`'s free-text grid couldn't support. Purely
  additive — `timetable_data` display is untouched.

## Service
`academicService.js` — plain CRUD + validation over
`classRepository.js`, same shape as `staffService.js`. No timetable
upload→structured-data sync logic yet (flagged, not built).

## API
`backend/src/routes/classes.js`, `facultyAllocation.js`,
`timetablePeriods.js` — all under `/api/v1/`.

## UI
`classesList` repointed to the real API (`dbe8380`).

## Known gaps / deferred
- No raw timetable file storage (needs DocumentService — didn't exist
  until Module 6; not retrofitted here).
- No CSV-upload logic that populates `timetable_data` and
  `faculty_allocation` together — real AcademicService logic, deferred.
