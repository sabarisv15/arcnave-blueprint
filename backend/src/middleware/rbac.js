// Platform API's own auth (its own JWT type, its own secret) isn't
// rebuilt in Node yet, and mixing it into this file would be exactly
// the cross-boundary confusion ADR-010 rules out — same reasoning the
// deleted Python version's app/api/platform/deps.py docstring gave
// for keeping require_platform_admin structurally separate from
// require_role, never unified.
//
// Neither function below decides which roles exist. BusinessRules.md
// leaves the tenant role model an explicitly open question (no
// "College Admin" role yet; whether "Class Tutor" becomes a role
// rather than a Faculty assignment is resolved during Module 2, not
// guessed at here). requireRole takes whatever role strings a route
// passes it — there is no role list anywhere in this file.
//
// No DB lookup in either function: role is a claim already embedded
// in the access token at login (security.js's createAccessToken).
// Trusting it here means trusting the token's signature —
// AuthMiddleware already verified that before this middleware ever
// runs, and left req.jwtClaims null for anything that didn't verify
// (missing, malformed, expired, tampered) — RBAC does not need to
// re-derive *why* a token was untrustworthy, only that it was.

  // platform token has no role claim at all, so it would already fail
  // requireRole's allowed-set check without this — but being explicit
  // here means that's not the only thing standing between the two
  // token types, same reasoning the deleted Python require_role had.
