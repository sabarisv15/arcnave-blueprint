// Outermost middleware — registered first in app.js, before
// authMiddleware, so everything downstream (including
// authMiddleware/tenantMiddleware's own mutations to req and to the
// AsyncLocalStorage store — see tenant.js, which mutates
// getRequestContext().collegeId in place rather than starting a
// second context) happens inside the context this middleware
// establishes.
//
// One res.on('finish', ...) hook logs exactly once per request,
// success or error alike — unlike tenant.js's commit/rollback pair
// (which needs exactly one of two DIFFERENT DB operations to run,
// hence its `settled` guard), the access log is the SAME operation
// regardless of outcome, and 'finish' fires unconditionally once a
// response has actually been sent, whether that response came from a
// route handler completing normally or from errorHandler.js
// eventually calling res.status(500).json(...). No separate
// error-path hook needed — this is the answer to "both the
// res.on('finish') success path and the error path" the build brief
// asked about: they're the same hook, not two.
//
// This callback reads req.requestId/req.collegeId directly, NOT
// getRequestContext() — stated plainly, as asked, rather than
// silently picking one: `req` is already a reliable plain-object
// closure reference (mutated in place by tenantMiddleware before
// 'finish' ever fires), so there's no reason to route through
// AsyncLocalStorage for data already sitting on a variable this
// function already closes over. This is NOT a workaround for a known
// propagation gap the way the Python version's equivalent read
// (request.state instead of the contextvar) was forced to be — it's
// simply the more direct option that happens to exist here. The
// AsyncLocalStorage path itself (getRequestContext(), used by
// logger.js everywhere code doesn't have `req` in scope — e.g.
// authService.refresh) is proven separately, empirically, by
// tests/request-logging.test.js's concurrent-requests test.
