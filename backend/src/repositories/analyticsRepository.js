// Query mechanics for Module 10's first Analytics slice — no business
// logic (rate math/rounding is AnalyticsService's job, not this
// file's — see .ai/TASK.md).
//
// attendanceRateByClass JOINs attendance_sessions to classes, a
// different domain's table (Attendance owns attendance_sessions,
// Academic owns classes) — CLAUDE.md rule 4 ("repositories never call
// other repositories") governs function-to-function calls, not SQL
// table access, and staffRepository.js's findByCollegeDepartmentAndRole/
// findByCollegeAndRole already JOIN `users` (Auth/Platform's table)
// directly for the identical reason: the query genuinely needs both
// tables' columns (class_name here, same as staff needing users.role
// there), and there is no repository-owned function this could call
// instead without an N+1 loop per class. Same precedent, not
// reinvented.
//
// No explicit college_id filter beyond RLS: both attendance_sessions
// and classes carry their own tenant_isolation policy (Module 4 /
// Module 3 migrations), so a JOIN between them can never cross a
// tenant boundary — same reasoning classRepository.js's
// findByTutorUserId gives for relying on RLS alone rather than
// duplicating a filter RLS already guarantees.
//
// deleted_at IS NULL filters soft-deleted attendance_sessions rows
// (same convention attendanceRepository.js's own reads use); classes
// has no soft-delete column yet (flagged, not decided, in
// classRepository.js's own header comment) so there's nothing to
// filter there.
//
// jsonb_array_length(absent_student_ids) turns the JSONB array
// attendanceService.markAttendance writes back into a present-count
// in SQL, rather than pulling every row's raw absent_student_ids back
// to Node and counting there — this query only ever needs the count,
// never the actual student ids, so aggregating in Postgres avoids
// shipping rows this slice has no other use for.
//
// Returns raw sums (total_marked, total_present, sessions_count) per
// class, not a computed rate: division-by-zero (a class with zero
// total_students recorded) and rounding are business-logic judgment
// calls that belong in AnalyticsService, not baked into the query.
