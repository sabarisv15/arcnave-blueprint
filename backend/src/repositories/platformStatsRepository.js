// Query mechanics for the tenant -> platform stats rollup (Platform
// Admin module build, Phase B: plans/tingly-marinating-whistle.md).
// Two distinct halves live in this one file because they're two sides
// of the same rollup, not because they share a table:
//
// - collectTenantCounts reads tenant-owned tables (users/students/
//   staff/background_jobs) through a connection that already has
//   app.current_tenant set for one college — RLS-scoped, same as
//   every other tenant read in this codebase, not a bypass.
// - upsertCollegeStats / recordSyncError write the platform-owned
//   `platform_college_stats` table, which has no RLS and is written
//   outside of any tenant transaction.
//
// No business logic here — see services/platformStatsSyncService.js
// for the orchestration and error handling.
