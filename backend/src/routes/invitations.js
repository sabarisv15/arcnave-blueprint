// POST /invitations/accept — deliberately unauthenticated, and the
// only tenant-side route in this codebase that doesn't rely on
// tenantMiddleware's normal resolution for the tenant scope it
// operates under. Must be registered *before* authMiddleware/
// tenantMiddleware in tenantApp.js (like /health) — the caller has no
// `users` row and therefore no access token yet, so there is no
// subdomain/JWT/explicit-code signal to resolve a tenant from at all;
// the invitation token itself is the one-time credential proving they
// should be allowed to create one.
//
// This is the one genuinely new architectural problem the Python
// version never had to solve, since it never split into separate
// tenantApp/platformApp instances: this route needs its own
// transaction, scoped to the invitation's own college_id, opened
// *after* looking the invitation up rather than before. It reuses
// db/tenantTransaction.js's openTenantTransaction — the exact same
// commit/rollback machinery tenantMiddleware itself uses — rather
// than hand-rolling a second copy of that logic. tenant.js just went
// through a real, subtle bug in exactly that machinery (committing
// too late, after the response had already been sent); duplicating it
// here would risk reintroducing an equivalent bug independently, in a
// route with a much smaller test surface than tenantMiddleware's own.
