// Identity-Migration-Plan.md Phase 3 — internal resolver module, NOT a
// separately-callable service (see the plan's "Service architecture
// decision: identityService, internally split"). Only
// services/identityService.js may require this file; it must never be
// required directly by a route, an AI tool, or another resolver
// module — resolvers never call each other, mirroring CLAUDE.md's
// "repositories never call other repositories" one layer up.
//
// Resolves which position(s) a user actively occupies, in a given
// college, from position_occupants (ADR-021's append-only occupant
// ledger) — the pure "Position" half of the
// Position -> Institutional Position Account -> Occupant model.

const positionRepository = require('../../repositories/positionRepository');

// Returns every position this user currently, actively occupies in
// this college — normally zero or one (Level 1/Level 3 seats backfilled
// by Phase 2 each have exactly one active occupant at a time, per the
// unique-active-per-account index), but the shape is a list because
// nothing in the schema forbids a person from occupying more than one
// position at once (e.g. a HOD who is also given a Level 2 module-lead
// seat) — callers that need a single "primary" position should apply
// their own tie-break (identityService uses highest level = lowest
// number, i.e. Level 1 outranks Level 3), not assume this resolver
// picks one for them.
