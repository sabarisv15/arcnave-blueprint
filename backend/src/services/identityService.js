// The single public façade over the Position/Institutional Position
// Account/Occupant model (ADR-021). PositionResolver / ModuleResolver
// / DepartmentResolver / AssignmentResolver / VisibilityResolver /
// PositionSlotResolver live as plain-function internal modules under
// services/identity/*, never exposed to routes or AI tools directly,
// never calling each other — only this façade composes them.
// Routes/AI tools/workflowChainService must only ever require THIS
// file, never services/identity/* or repositories/positionRepository.js
// directly (mirrors CLAUDE.md rule 1 — "every AI tool calls a Business
// Service" — one layer down: identityService is that Business Service
// for identity/capability questions).
//
// Wired into Authorization (middleware/rbac.js, via
// middleware/identity.js), Workflow Routing (workflowChainService.js),
// Visibility/Data Scope (actorContextService.js), and Audit Identity
// (auditLogRepository.js) as of Phase 1. resolveCapabilities()'s return
// shape is frozen (see docs/adr/ADR-022-Identity-Resolver-Contract.md)
// — consumers build directly on it without reshaping it independently.
// resolvePositionOccupant() below is a second, later public entry
// point added in Phase 1's own conformance pass, once workflowChainService's
// actual need (a reverse, slot -> occupant lookup — resolveCapabilities
// only ever resolves the forward, user -> capabilities direction) turned
// out not to be covered by the frozen contract; adding it here keeps
// this file the sole owner of Position/Account/Occupant reads without
// touching resolveCapabilities()'s own shape at all.

// position -> 'staff' (the ADR-021 Level 4/person-centric default —
// see visibilityResolver's own docstring for why "no position found"
// is the expected staff case, not an error). A position holding BOTH
