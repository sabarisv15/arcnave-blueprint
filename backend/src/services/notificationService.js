// NotificationService (Module 8). Composes WorkflowService (approval)
// + external Email/SMS/WhatsApp providers, per Architecture.md 2.5.
// Two generations of behavior now coexist here, on purpose:
//
// 1. sendEmail/sendStaffCredentialsEmail — the original minimal slice.
//    UNCHANGED by this extension. sendStaffCredentialsEmail's only
//    caller (staffService.approveStaffRegistration) fires as the
//    direct, deterministic consequence of a real human approval
//    WorkflowService already recorded (the Principal's own final
//    sign-off on the registration chain) — there is no free-form or
//    AI-drafted content in that path for the new ledger below to gate,
//    so it is deliberately NOT retrofitted into it. Still send-first
//    (never a Draft row), still best-effort (a failed send never
//    throws, never rolls back the staff activation that triggered it).
//
// 2. draftNotification/submitForApproval/approveNotification/
//    rejectNotification/dispatchApprovedNotification — the real
//    `notifications`/`notification_delivery` ledger this file's
//    original comment flagged as a future gap (Architecture.md 2.8):
//    "every outbound notification is a row before it's sent... draft
//    -> approved -> dispatched." This is the path any FUTURE caller
//    with actual discretionary content (an AI-drafted announcement, a
//    bulk SMS blast, anything not already gated by a completed
//    approval) MUST use — never sendEmail directly. `notifications`
//    has no schema-level 'Pending' status (unlike workflow_requests):
//    "awaiting approval" lives entirely on the workflow_requests row a
//    Draft is submitted against (via workflow_request_id), so the two
//    tables can't drift out of sync on what counts as pending.
//    approveNotification/rejectNotification mirror
//    financeService.approveFeeStructure/rejectFeeStructure exactly —
//    status only ever moves off 'Draft' as the real consequence of
//    workflowService.approveRequest/rejectRequest actually resolving,
//    never a direct caller-supplied status write.
//
// Three real channels: email/sms/whatsapp, each via a per-vendor
// adapter under notificationProviders/ (PROVIDER_REGISTRY below) — no
// nodemailer/Twilio/HTTP calls of this file's own anymore (item 2/4 of
// this session's task). The legacy sendEmail path (staff credentials,
// password reset, principal invitation) still uses the global
// config.smtp fallback via smtpProvider; the ledger path
// (dispatchApprovedNotification) and Send Alert (item 5) resolve a
// per-college provider from college_notification_channels via
// genericSend/resolveChannelProvider. No SMTP_HOST/channel row
// configured is the expected default in dev/test: sending logs the
// message instead of attempting to send. A configured-but-failing send
// is also never fatal — delivery is recorded as failed (a real
// notification_delivery row for the ledger path, still just a log line
// for the legacy sendStaffCredentialsEmail path), not thrown, so a
// transient delivery problem never blocks the caller.
// dispatchApprovedNotification applies that same "best-effort, never
// undo the approval" philosophy to the ledger: it always advances a
// notification to 'Dispatched' after attempting delivery, recording
// whatever genericSend actually returned ('sent'/'stubbed'/'failed') in
// notification_delivery rather than blocking the status transition on
// send success — a failed send is a fact to record/retry later, not a
// reason to leave the already-approved notification stuck.
